                <p>
                    Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS (/ˈʃriːniˌvɑːsə rɑːˈmɑːnʊdʒən/;[1] About this sound listen (help·info); 22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920)[2] was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India.
                    Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics,
                     he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions,
                     including solutions to mathematical problems considered to be unsolvable. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research
                     in isolation: "He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part.
                     What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered"

                  Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science</p>

                <h2>Nikolai Luzin</h2>
                <p>
                    Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin (also spelled Lusin;   9 December 1883 – 28 January 1950) was a Soviet/Russian mathematician known for his work in descriptive set theory and aspects of mathematical analysis with strong connections to point-set topology. He was
                    the eponym of Luzitania, a loose group of young Moscow mathematicians of the first half of the 1920s. They adopted his set-theoretic orientation, and went on to apply it in other areas of mathematics.
